<h1>My Work Experience</h1>


<p>After STPM, I had work as a frontdesk receptionist at Hotel Seksyen 15 Shah Alam, Selangor for 3 months. What I learned from there is I could improve my communication skills and how to handle a problem with a customer. The problem that I had to face it is they complain about the cleaniness, and sometimes they are too picky which is they want a new sheets and blankets while it is just been changed. During my time working there, there are a various of customers behaviour that I have meet and the experience that I have gain there has taught me a lot of things.</p>
